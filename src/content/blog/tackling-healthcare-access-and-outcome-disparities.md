## Nerves Mean You Care—Use Them

Pressure is not the enemy; it is information. A faster heart rate, shaky hands, or racing thoughts are signs your nervous system is working to protect you. The moment you label those sensations as proof you are unprepared, performance spirals.

Reframing nerves into fuel starts with acceptance. Tell yourself, *“My body is preparing to do something important.”* This tiny cognitive shift interrupts catastrophic thinking and keeps you anchored to what you can control.

**Try this:**
- Inhale for four counts, hold for two, and exhale for six while naming what you feel out loud.
- Pair the exhale with a cue word such as “steady” or “attack.”
- Repeat the cycle three times before visualizing your first action when the whistle blows.

## Script Competition Day Like a Pilot Checklist

Pilots follow the same steps before every flight regardless of conditions. High performers do the same. When you script your morning, travel, warm-up, and post-competition decompression, you remove unnecessary decisions that drain focus.

Create a script that covers:
1. **What you eat and when you hydrate**
2. **Your activation exercises**
3. **Trigger cues** that remind you how you want to feel
4. **Regroup plan** if something unexpected happens

Write the script, practice it in training, and store it somewhere visible on game day. The more familiar it feels, the more bandwidth you have for tactical decisions.

## Give Your Brain Data, Not Drama

After competition, most athletes replay only the mistakes. That bias teaches your brain to fear the next event. Instead, collect data:

- Rate focus, confidence, and energy from 1–10.
- Note moments when you stayed composed as well as ones where you lost it.
- Identify what triggered each response.

Within a few competitions, you can see patterns. Maybe late starts spike anxiety, or maybe you thrive when you connect with teammates beforehand. Data over drama allows us to adjust your routines with precision.
